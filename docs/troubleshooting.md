# Troubleshooting

At the first meaningful failure, preserve the symptom, timestamp and current state and use Progressive Investigation under the [shared policy](../skill/references/collaboration-policy.md). Distinguish instruction/catalog/browser failures from local bridge faults before repair. A new attempt needs new evidence and a changed strategy; a retry cap never authorizes an identical blind repeat.

For a suspected local connection fault, use the following diagnostic only within existing authorization for local state reads and endpoint persistence:

```
c2c doctor --no-fix --json -w <workspace>
```

`--no-fix` disables repair actions; it does not guarantee read-only execution. A healthy tunnel can still persist endpoint metadata and refresh its `savedAt` timestamp. Doctor/status diagnostics read runtime state and can use the local admin token internally; never inspect or disclose that token. For strictly read-only inspection without runtime or credential access, inspect source and nonsecret repository metadata instead. Doctor without `--no-fix` can restart the bridge/tunnel and edit local configuration. Use repair only for a diagnosed fault within existing authorization; preserve uncertain-state and denial gates. A healthy local bridge is not permission to recreate a connector for browser/catalog/instruction loading problems.

## Common situations

### "Bridge 未运行"
`c2c start` (or let doctor do it). Bridge logs:
`c2c logs`, or verbose: `c2c logs --verbose`.

If doctor says the bridge state is **uncertain** (无法确认), do not start a
second bridge and do not Delete the ChatGPT connector. Wait and run doctor
again. The local process may still be running.

### Codex Web GPT launcher or model catalog is missing

This repository installs the Codex Skill and the C2C Bridge. It does **not**
ship the separate `Codex Web GPT` desktop launcher or the native Codex model
catalog UI. If that launcher says **Install into Codex / 安装到 Codex** is
incomplete, separate route installation from catalog verification:

- The launcher can successfully write its local `openai_base_url` route while
  the existing Codex process is still using the old configuration.
- Fully quit Codex, including its background/tray `ChatGPT.exe` process on
  Microsoft Store Windows installations, then reopen it. Closing only the
  window is not a restart. Keep the launcher open while it verifies the
  catalog.
- Repeating the install step does not reload an already-running Codex process.
  It only writes the same route again and can reset the pending verification
  state.

For the C2C repository itself, verify the checkout and installed Skill path,
rebuild with `corepack pnpm install && corepack pnpm build` when authorized, then run these ordinary diagnostics only within authorization for runtime reads and possible endpoint persistence:

```
c2c doctor --no-fix --json -w <workspace>
c2c status --json -w <workspace>
```

If those checks are healthy but the separate Web GPT launcher or model picker
still fails, capture the OS, Codex version, launcher version, exact UI error,
and timestamp for the launcher issue. Do not change tunnel settings or delete
the saved route as a workaround: the launcher owns its route backup and is
expected to restore it when its Bridge is turned off.

### Everything was quit and ChatGPT can no longer connect
Quitting Codex / the terminal stops the public address. The next `c2c doctor`
starts a new address and sets `chatgptRepair.needed`. The Skill should tell the
user that the old address expired, then **Delete** THIS workspace's
connector (`chatgptRepair.connectorName`) and create it again with the new
address (never click Reconnect — the old URL is dead). Other workspaces keep
their own connectors so two projects can stay connected at once.

Mint the pairing code only when the ChatGPT Authorize form is on screen
(`c2c pair`). After the connector is recreated, doctor being green is not
enough: the saved ChatGPT conversation must pass `workspace_info` again. If
that old chat still cannot read the workspace, open a new chat in the same
Project (or switch long-chat) and continue there.

Fixed ChatGPT pages for first-time setup and later repair (do not hunt the UI):

- Developer mode: https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Security
- Plugins hub (manage existing connectors): https://chatgpt.com/plugins
- Add a connector:
  https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins

### Tunnel URL unreachable / ChatGPT says the connector is broken
Same as above: `c2c doctor`, then Delete + recreate THIS workspace's
connector if `chatgptRepair.needed`. Mint a pairing code with `c2c pair` only
when the Authorize form is on screen.
If this workspace uses a stable hostname, doctor sets `namedRepair` instead —
re-login to Cloudflare (`c2c tunnel login`) only under the connection reference’s explicit browser-consent condition, and doctor again. Do not Delete
the connector; the address did not change.

### I have a Cloudflare domain and want a stable hostname
During first-time setup (or the next coding session, once), say you have a
Cloudflare account and give the domain. Cloudflare login follows the explicit browser-consent condition in [connection and recovery](../skill/references/connection-and-recovery.md); a domain choice alone does not authorize opening your own browser. After authorized login, C2C keeps `c2c-<project>.your-domain.com`. To stay on the temporary
address, say you do not have a domain. Switching later: tell Codex you want
the stable hostname; it runs `c2c tunnel choose --mode named --zone <domain>`.

### "配对码无效/过期"
Pairing codes are one-time and expire after ~5 minutes. Generate one only
when the ChatGPT Authorize page is ready:

```
c2c pair
```

Older codes become invalid immediately. Do not mint a code during `c2c doctor`.

### Temporary address keeps dropping on a UDP-filtered network
cloudflared defaults to QUIC. If the tunnel reconnects over and over on a
corporate network, set `C2C_TUNNEL_PROTOCOL=http2` and restart the bridge.
Leave it unset to keep cloudflared's default.

### ChatGPT gets 401 on every tool call
The access token expired and refresh failed (e.g. after `c2c unpair` or a
long offline period). Delete THIS workspace's connector if the address also
changed; otherwise run Authorize again in ChatGPT and enter a fresh pairing
code. Never use Reconnect when the public address has been replaced.

### cloudflared is not installed
macOS: `brew install cloudflared`
Windows: `winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared`
Linux: see Cloudflare's package instructions.
The Skill installs this automatically during setup.
If cloudflared is installed in a custom location that is not on `PATH`, set
`C2C_CLOUDFLARED_PATH` to the executable's absolute path before running `c2c`.

### Every new Codex chat “repairs” the connection / cannot write logs
The C2C state directory lives outside the project (macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/codex-with-chatgpt`; Windows:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\codex-with-chatgpt`). Codex's default sandbox cannot write
there, so each new chat looks like a health-check failure.

`c2c setup`, `c2c doctor` and `c2c sandbox-allow` add that directory to
`[sandbox_workspace_write].writable_roots` in `<codex-home>/config.toml`, where
`<codex-home>` is a non-empty `CODEX_HOME` when set, otherwise `~/.codex`
(`%USERPROFILE%\.codex` on Windows). After that, later chats do not need
elevation.

### Port already in use
Handled automatically: an existing healthy bridge for the same workspace is
reused; anything else makes the bridge pick a free port. Configuration follows
automatically.

### Fixed hostname is configured, but the Named Tunnel does not start on Windows
`cert.pem` and the Named Tunnel credential are different files. `cert.pem`
proves that `cloudflared` has an account certificate; the tunnel still needs
`%USERPROFILE%\.cloudflared\<TUNNEL-UUID>.json` (or the file selected by
`TUNNEL_CRED_FILE`) to run. `c2c doctor --json` reports whether the certificate
is missing, the credential is missing or unreadable, the JSON is invalid, or
the saved Tunnel ID does not match. It never prints credential contents or
repairs the file automatically.

When the diagnostic says the credential is missing, recover the credential for
the existing Tunnel with `cloudflared tunnel token --cred-file` and then run
`c2c doctor` again. Do not paste the generated credential into ChatGPT or a
project file.

### Reading a file returns ACCESS_DENIED_SENSITIVE_FILE
Working as intended: `.env`, keys, credentials and anything matched by
`.c2cignore` are never readable through ChatGPT. `.env.example` is allowed.

### I cannot see Projects in the ChatGPT sidebar
Hover **Chats** /「聊天」, click the … that appears, and choose
**Organize by project** /「按项目整理」. Then create a project named after
this workspace, with **project-only memory**. Tell Codex「好了」when the
collection page is open (`https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-…/project`).

### This workspace opened the wrong ChatGPT Project
Do not pick another project by name automatically. Open the collection that
matches this workspace and tell Codex「已找到」, or say you want the old
long-chat instead. Each workspace has its own Project and its own connector.

### Diagnosed bridge recovery remains blocked

Preserve Doctor evidence and the current bindings/checkpoint. Return an unresolved cause to Chat; do not reset merely because progress stalled. Only when evidence identifies bridge recovery as necessary and that effect is authorized may the existing recovery workflow use `c2c stop` / `c2c setup`. Never use that sequence for an instruction/catalog problem, an uncertain running process or an access denial. No blind second wave, deletion of unrelated connectors, or trust/permission workaround.
